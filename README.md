All TSVs were produced using kathairo.py.

This repo contains two kinds of TSVs: 
1. verse-level (where each row is a verse)
2. token-level (where each row is a token).

Verse-level TSVs can be found at `language_code/translation_abbreviation/verse`.  
Token-level TSVs can be found at `language_code/translation_abbreviation/token`.   

A TSV's version number is indicated by its creation date.  Dates are in the format year, month, day (ex. 20252402 is February 24th, 2025).  The latest version of a translation has both a dated and undated version.

Many Bible translations come with inaccurate versification files.  The contents of the `versification_issues` directory record the faults of the latest TSV's versification, if there are any.
